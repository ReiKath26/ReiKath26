### Howdy, folks! ☘️ 👋

I'm a final year undergraduate Computer Science student from Bina Nusantara University focusing on Multimedia Programming Study. I love to learn new things, particularly things related to game and mobile development, also design related stuff, 3D or 2D. I'm also recent graduate of Apple Developer Academy @BINUS and have made some apps and games to solve real life problems there, which you can definitely check out in my github repositories or my team github repositories.

### More about me

💻 Code Language I have mastered so far: C++, C#, Java, HTML, JavaScript, CSS, PHP, Swift, Objective-C

🎓I'm on the final stage of my thesis project and will face my thesis defense at the end of February. Should everything goes well, I'll be free to explore beyond college life afterwards. Wish me luck!

🥂 I'm interested in game and mobile app development. I'm currently learning game development on both unity and unreal. I also currently improving my iOS Development to expand from what I learned in the academy (particularly on the use of external library and networking concept in Swift, as well as the Design Patterns). I would also like to learn other tech stack, like Machine Learning, AR/VR, etc in the future!

💎 I can do low poly 3D Modeling, currently learning to make a more detailed model

👌🏻 I work with an amazing group of people during my time in the academy, being part of the iCU team. If you want to check out our work, like our folklore storytelling iOS AR Game, Carita, you can go to our team repository here: https://github.com/iCUTeam (Do check out other members git as well if you would like!)
